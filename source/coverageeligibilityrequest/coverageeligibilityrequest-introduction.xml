<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The CoverageEligibilityRequest makes a request of an insurer asking them to provide, in the form of an CoverageEligibilityResponse, 
information regarding: (validation) whether the specified coverage(s) is valid and in-force; (discovery) what coverages the insurer has for the specified patient; (benefits)
the benefits provided under the coverage; whether benefits exist under the specified coverage(s) for specified classes of services and products; and (auth-requirements) 
whether preauthorization is required, and if so what information may be required in that preauthorization, for the specified service classes or services.
</p>

		<p>The CoverageEligibilityRequest resource is a "event" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html#event">Workflow Event.</a></p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
CoverageEligibilityRequest should be used when requesting whether the patient's coverage is inforce, whether it is valid at this or a specified date, or requesting the benefit details or preauthorization requirements associated with a coverage.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="claim.html">Claim</a> resource should be used to request the adjudication and/or authorization of a set of healthcare-related goods and services for a patient against the patient's insurance coverages, or to request what the adjudication would be for a supplied set of goods or services should they be actually supplied to the patient.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="coverage.html">Coverage</a> resource contains the information typically found on the health insurance card for an individual used to identify the covered individual to the insurer and is referred to by the CoverageEligibilityRequest.
