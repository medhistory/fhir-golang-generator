This specification defines data elements, resources, formats, methods and APIs for
exchanging healthcare data between different participants in the healthcare process.
As such, Clinical Safety is a key concern with regard to the specification and its many and various
implementations.

This page, and the concept of <i>safety</i> in an API specification, needs further development.

<h3>Implementer's Safety Check List</h3>
<p>
FHIR is as simple to implement as we know how to make it. However, due to the nature of
healthcare, and healthcare processes, and cultural concerns, there are a number of features in
FHIR that implementers are obliged to consider in order to implement safe systems.
</p>
<p>
This section is a check list to help implementers be sure that they've considered all the parts
of FHIR that impact on their system design with regard to safety.
</p>
<!--
list underlying assumptions about deployment
-->

<ol>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> Production exchange of patient or other sensitive data will always use some form of <a href="security.html#http">encryption on the wire</a></li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> For each resource that my system handles, I've reviewed the <a href="conformance-rules.html#isModifier">Modifier elements</a></li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system checks for <a href="extensibility.html#modifierExtension">modifierExtension</a> elements</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system supports <a href="conformance-rules.html#mustSupport">elements labeled as "must-support"</a> in the <a href="profiling.html">profiles</a> that apply to my system</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> All resources in use are <a href="validation.html">valid</a> against the base specification and the <a href="profiling.html">profiles</a> that apply to my system (see note about the <a href="validation.html#correct-use">correct run-time use of validation</a>)</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> For each resource that my system handles, my system handles the full <a href="lifecycle.html">Life cycle</a> (status codes, currency issues, and erroneous entry status)</li>
 <li><b>Deleting Records</b> 
   <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
     <li><input type="checkbox"/> For each resource, I have checked whether resources can be deleted, and/or how records are marked as incorrect/no longer relevant</li>
     <li><input type="checkbox"/> Deletion of records (or equivalent updates in status) flow through the system so any replicated copies are deleted/updated</li>
     <li><input type="checkbox"/> (If a server) my documentation about deleted resources is clear, and my test sandbox (if exists) has deleted/error record cases in the test data</li>   
   </ol>
 </li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system can <a href="narrative.html#css">render narratives properly</a> and <a href="security.html#narrative">securely</a>(where they are used)</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system has documented how <a href="managing.html#distributed">distributed resource identification</a> works in its relevant contexts of use, and where (and why) <a href="references.html#contained">contained</a> resources are used</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system manages lists of <a href="lifecycle.html#current">current resources</a> correctly</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system makes the right <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> statements and <a href="auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a> logs, and uses the right <a href="security-labels.html#core">security labels</a> where appropriate</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system checks that the right <a href="consent.html">Patient consent</a> has been granted (where applicable)</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> When other systems <a href="http.html#summary">return http errors from the RESTful API</a> and <a href="operations.html">Operations</a> (perhaps using <a href="operationoutcome.html">Operation Outcome</a>), my system checks for them and handles them appropriately
   <ul><li><input type="checkbox"/> For search, my system will display warnings returned by the server to the user</li></ul>
 </li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system caters for <a href="search.html#missing">parameters that have missing values</a> when doing search operations, and responds correctly to the client with regard to <a href="search.html#errors">erroneous search parameters</a></li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system ensures that system clocks are synchronized using a protocol like NTP or SNTP, or my server is robust against clients that have the wrong clock set</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system ensures checks for patient links (and/or merges) and handles data that is linked to patients accordingly</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system publishes a <a href="capabilitystatement.html">Capability Statement</a> with <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinitions</a>, <a href="valueset.html">ValueSets</a>, and <a href="operationdefinition.html">OperationDefinitions</a>, etc., so other implementers know how the system functions</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system checks for timezones, and adjusts times appropriately. (note: timezones are extremely difficult to get correct - see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/timezone/">W3C Timezone Advice</a>, and note that some fields should be timezone corrected, and others should not be)</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> My system renders dates safely for changes in culture and language (the date formats D-M-Y and M-D-Y are not differentiated for many dates, and this is a well known source of confusion. Systems should use the month name, or otherwise be specific for each date when rendering, unless
   there is solid confidence that such confusion cannot arise, even in the future when information/narrative from resources will be shared much more widely)</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> I've reviewed the <a href="observation.html">Observation</a> resource, and understand how <code>focus</code> is a mechanism for observations to be about someone or something other than the pateint or subject of record.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Obviously this list is only a small part of the overall safety check list for an application, which will have checks regarding jurisdictionally mandated policies, internal integrity, etc.
</p>
<p>
In addition, server developers should check these specific additional checks for client convenience:
</p>
<ol>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> Server: CORS (<a href="http://enable-cors.org/">cross-origin resource sharing</a>) is appropriately enabled (many clients are Javascript apps running in a browser)</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> JSON is supported (many clients are Javascript apps running in a browser; XML is inconvenient at best)</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> JSON is returned correctly when errors happen (clients often don't handle HTML errors well)</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> The _format header is supported correctly</li>
 <li><input type="checkbox"/> Errors are trapped and an OperationOutcome returned</li>
</ol>
