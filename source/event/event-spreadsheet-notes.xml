  <h2>Extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Not all resources that follow the 'Event' pattern will necessarily include all of the above elements.  A set of standard extensions have been defined
    for use with resources where an element might be "applicable" but is not commonly supported.  A list of these can be found on the 
    <a href="event-extensions.html">Event Extensions</a>(event-specific) and <a href="workflow-extensions.html">Workflow Extensions</a>(shared by events
    and requests).

  <h2>State Machine</h2>
  <p>
    The following diagram shows the "typical" state machine diagram for resources following the Event
    pattern.  Note that not all resources will support all states, some resources may choose different names
    for certain states and some resources may introduce sub-states to the listed states.  As well, additional
    transitions may be supported, including from terminal nodes (e.g. from "completed" back to "in-progress").
    That said, most resources should align with this state machine fairly well.
