<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The DeviceDefinition resource is used to describe the characteristics and capabilities of a medical device.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The DeviceDefinition resource contains the "catalog" definition of a device - whether that definition is authored by the regulatory entities, or it is a local definition that includes assembled device configurations.
The DeviceDefinition allows defining hierarchical device configurations (devices as part of other devices).
</p>
<p>
Device vs deviceDefinition:
The Device resource is meant to refer to a physical instance of a device - hence having attributes like lot number, patient, location, which the DeviceDefinition resource does not have.
