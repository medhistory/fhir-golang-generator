<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The ClaimResponse resource provides application level adjudication results, or an application level error,
 which are the result of processing a submitted Claim resource where that Claim may be which is the functional corollary of 
 a Claim, Pre-Determination or a Pre-Authorization.
 </p>
 <p>
 This is the adjudicated response to a Claim, Pre-determination or Pre-Authorization. The strength 
 of the payment aspect of the response is matching to the strength of the original request. For a 
 Claim the adjudication indicates payment which is intended to be made, for Pre-Authorization and 
 Pre-Determination no payment will actually be made however funds may be reserved to settle a claim 
 submitted later. Only an actual claim may be expected to result in actual payment.
 </p>
<p>
The ClaimResponse resource is the response for the submission of: Claim, Re-adjudication 
and Reversals.
</p>
<p>
The ClaimResponse may have been created by interpreting the corresponding Claim resource as a request for payment (the oldest sense of a claim), a request for preauthorization or a request for predetermination. These interpretations are described at the Claim resource. It is possible for the consumer of the ClaimResponse resource to know the manner in which the Claim resource was processed by checking the Claim.use code.
</p>
<p>
Where the producer of the ClaimResponse resource interpreted the Claim as a traditional claim, the contents of the ClaimResponse includes information that the producer of the ClaimResponse intends to pay. The actual payment, however, is conveyed separately, perhaps through an eletronic funds transfer protocol outside the domain of FHIR or possibly by a paper check.
</p>
<p>
However, when the producer of the ClaimResponse interpreted the Claim as request for preauthorization or predetermination, the ClaimResponse does not imply that such a payment is pending. Actual payment would only follow the interpretation fo a Claim resource as a traditional claim.
