		<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
		<p>
The VisionPrescription resource is intended to support the information requirements for a prescription for glasses and contact lenses for a patient.
Corrective optical lenses are considered a controlled substance and therefore a prescription is typically required for the provision of 
patient-specific lenses.  
		</p>
		<p>
Vision prescriptions may only be issued by providers who have optical diagnosis within their scope of practice, typically ophthalmologists  
and optometrists. The prescription is a time-limited, typically two years, authorization for the provision of an unlimited number of lenses, 
glasses or contacts, which conform to the authorized specification by providers which have lens provision within their scope of practice, typically ophthalmologists  
, optometrists and opticians. 
		</p>
		<p>Health insurers typically require a copy of the prescription to ensure that a vision professional has examined the patient and that the
 power of the lenses exceeds some minimum, such as +- 0.75 diopters, to qualify for reimbursement under the insurance coverage.</p>
		<p>The VisionPrescription resource is an "request" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html#request">Workflow Request.</a></p>
