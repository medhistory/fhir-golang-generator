<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The CoverageEligibilityResponse resource provides eligibility and plan details from the processing of an 
CoverageEligibilityRequest resource. It combines key information from a payor as to whether a Coverage is 
in-force, and optionally the nature of the Policy benefit details as well as the ability for the insurer to indicate whether 
the insurance provides benefits for requested types of services or requires preauthorization and if so what supporting
information may be required.
</p>

		<p>The CoverageEligibilityResponse resource is a "event" resource from a FHIR workflow perspective - see <a href="workflow.html#event">Workflow Event.</a></p>
