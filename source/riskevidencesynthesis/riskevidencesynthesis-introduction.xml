<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The scope of the RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource is to describe the likelihood of an outcome in a population with an exposure where the risk estimate is derived from the combination of research studies. Risk estimates are not effects and do not represent a difference between exposure states.

Expressing risk estimates is done throughout reporting of biomedical research, systematic reviews, and clinical reference across all disciplines.

Risk estimates as a "synthesis" of research studies is a different concept for risk estimation than risk estimates for an individual person.
<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource will reference:

EvidenceVariable
citation (an expected resource for future proposal)

EffectEvidenceSynthesis is about the difference (or "effect") between an exposure and alternative exposure state on an outcome in a population. RiskEvidenceSynthesis is about the "risk" of an outcome with an exposure state in a population. RiskEvidenceSytnhesis does not include an alternative exposure state of difference between states.</p>

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>The RiskEvidenceSynthesis resource describes:

the point estimate for the risk or specific value with one exposure (without comparison to or difference from an alternative exposure)
classification of the risk type (continuous or dichotomous, mean, median, proportion, etc.)
a precision estimate (such as 95% confidence intervals)
rating of certainty of the risk estimate
descriptions of the population, exposure, and outcome that the risk estimate is about
descriptions of the source of the risk estimate (eg author, citation, type of research, sample size)
