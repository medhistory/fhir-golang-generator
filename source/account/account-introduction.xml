<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The Account resource acts as a central record against which charges, payments, and adjustments are applied.  It contains information about which parties are responsible for payment of the account.
</p>
<p>
While the Account does conceptually have a balance, expressing that balance directly as a resource property is challenging due to the complexity of pricing contracts.  An operation to retrieve the current balance of an account is in consideration as future work.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The Account itself does not include information about the charges, payments or adjustments, but rather those resources, such as ChargeItem point to the account to which they apply.  Payment and adjustment resources have not yet been developed.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
The Account resource can be considered a "bucket" to which ChargeItem resources are linked.  These charges are processed by a billing system, which determines the responsible parties for the balance of the account.  The billing system then submits claims or sends statements to the appropriate parties.  Once payment is received, an adjustment is applied to the Account.  The internal calculation of balances and allocation of responsibility is expected to be internal to the billing systems.  Only the inputs and outputs of the billing process is communicated in the relevant financial FHIR resources.
