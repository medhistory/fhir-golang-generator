<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p> 
A document manifest gathers a set of Resources 
into a single package with some clinical context that may be the subject of workflow such as targeted delivery. 
The usage of "document" in the case of DocumentManifest, covers the broader scope of "document" as defined in REST and HTTP. 
This use is not limited to the formal "Document" model used for <a href="documents.html">FHIR documents</a> or <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> resources.
</p>
<p>
Typically, DocumentManifest resources are used in document indexing systems, such as <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=Cross-Enterprise_Document_Sharing">IHE XDS</a>.
Such as profiled in <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Mobile_access_to_Health_Documents_(MHD)">IHE Mobile access to Health Documents</a>.
When used as a Manifest of "Documents" in this way, the DocumentManifest will point exclusively to <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> resources.
</p>
<p>
A DocumentManifest resource could be used to bring clinical context grouping to a broader set of Resources.</p>
