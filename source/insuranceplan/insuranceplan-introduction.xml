<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
A product is a discrete package of health insurance coverage benefits that are offered under
a particular network type. A given payerâ€™s products typically differ by network type and/or 
coverage benefits. A plan pairs the health insurance coverage benefits under a product with
the particular cost sharing structure offered to a consumer. A given product may comprise multiple plans.

InsurancePlan describes a health insurance offering comprised of a list of covered benefits 
(i.e. the product), costs associated with those benefits (i.e. the plan), and additional 
information about the offering, such as who it is owned and administered by, a coverage area,
