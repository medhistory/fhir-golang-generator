Notes:
</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Multiple instances of an OrganizationAffilitiation may exist between the same 2 organizations if
    a specific combination of the other related properties is required, or has a different period of usage.<br/>
    Some systems record a collection of service values for a single location, others record the 
    single service and the list of locations it is available. Both are acceptable options for representing this data.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the HealthcareService contains more locations than specified in the Affilition, then only those in the Affiliation 
    are relevant in the OrganizationAffiliation, it cannot introduce new locations not covered by the HealthcareService.<br/>
    Conversely if no Locations are specified, then it can be assumed that all locations are available.
  </li>
  <li>
    For some types of affiliation the HealthcareService might not be relevant and be empty, and location could be included.
  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Joint Ventures</h2>
  <p>
  With a joint venture between multiple organizations, a seperate Organization is created which represents the Venture.
  Each Organization in the venture is created through a seperate OrganizationAffiliation resource with
  the telecom details provided in each being the contact point to call for enquiries relating to their affiliation in the venture.
