<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The EligibilityRequest provides patient and insurance coverage information to an insurer for them to respond, in the form of an Eligibility Response,
with information regarding whether the stated coverage is valid and in-force, and potentially the amount of coverage which may be available to any 
services classes identified in this request.
</p>
<p>
<b>For Balloters:</b> The optional <b>Authorization</b> subclass has been added for comment ballot review. It is intended to convey the billable services which may be performed and for which the provider wishes to determine
whether it needs to submit a prior authorization (pre-authorization) request. The EligibilityResponse would return a boolean flag indicating whether prior authorization is required and an optional text element would convey any 
special instructions.
