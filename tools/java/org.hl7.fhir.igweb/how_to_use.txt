To run this from an IDE:
 - Run the class "org.hl7.fhir.igweb.Runner"
 
Accessing it from a browser:
 - http://localhost:8888

REST access:
1. Upload the ZIP to http://localhost:8888/upload (use a content-type of "application/zip")
2. You will get a redirect header with a job ID, along the lines of:
  Location: /working?jobid=[UUID]
3. Keep that UUID, you will use it to poll for the response
4. Poll the following: http://localhost:8888/download?jobid=[UUID]
  - If you get a content type of text/plain, the job is not yet complete
  - If you get a content type of application/zip, the job is complete
  - If you get a redirect, the job failed
